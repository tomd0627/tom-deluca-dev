      Hi there! I'm <span class="section__highlight">Tom DeLuca</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="animate-fade">
      I'm a frontend developer based in New York, passionate about transforming
      designs into seamless, responsive websites. With a deep expertise in HTML,
      CSS, and JavaScript, I bring ideas to life on the web with precision and
      flair. Collaborating with others to create visually stunning and
      user-friendly sites is what I do best.

      Beyond the screen, you'll find me enjoying anime, gaming, or spending
      quality time with family and friends. And when Friday rolls around, Iâ€™m
      likely unwinding at a local bar with a good craft beer in hand.
